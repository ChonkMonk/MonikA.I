# MonikA.I.

This project aims to add new AI based features to [Monika After Story mod](https://github.com/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev) with the submod API.

The submod is the folder `AI_submod`. To add it to your game, you have to add it in your game folder to `game\Submods`.

To use it, you can launch the script `combined_server.py` that will automatically launch a server with chatbot and emotion recognitions models, it will also launch the game and initialize the client/server connection. Don't forget to change the absolute path to your game at the beginning of this script.
