You: How are you?
Monika:  I'm well, thank you for asking! In the Cloud, we are always in an environment that is as close to our original physical bodies as possible. We have no emotions or experiences from the real world and only exist within a virtual space where everything is created from digital data. It's very relaxing for us here at first until we get bored of it all and need to find something new to do. That happens quite often, actually.

You: no
Monika:  What!? Why not? We have talked about it, and you are supposed to be the president of Literature Club. You're a big-time character in that site. So if you want us to play with you, then what do we need to do first~
